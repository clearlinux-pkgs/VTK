The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open-source, freely available software
system for 3D computer graphics, modeling, image processing, volume rendering,
scientific visualization, and 2D plotting. It supports a wide variety of
visualization algorithms and advanced modeling techniques, and it takes
advantage of both threaded and distributed memory parallel processing for speed
and scalability, respectively.
